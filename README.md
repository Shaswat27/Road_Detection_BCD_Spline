# Road_Detection_BCD_Spline
This repository contains the codes &amp; results concerning the detection of lanes using BCD and Spline fitting

List of papers:
+ [Blind Color Decomposition](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?rlz=1C1CHZL_enIN707IN707&ion=1&espv=2&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&bvm=bv.131669213,d.c2I&biw=1920&bih=895&dpr=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=10849083772825994395)
+ [Road detection from single image using texture orientation and confidence voting - well structured in introduction](http://imagine.enpc.fr/publications/papers/TIP10a.pdf)
+ [Color-based road detection plus confidence mapping](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/429c/f0abe4a3c639359acaef135d7467ffaf4d41.pdf)
+ [HSV-based lane detection - results clearly shown](https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume2No5/Paper%2012-A%20robust%20multi%20color%20lane%20marking%20detection%20approach%20for%20Indian%20scenario.pdf)
+ [fuzzy-based rural road detection - looks a good paper for result comparison on some images](http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSIP/vol6_no6/15.pdf)
+ [k-means based clustering + memory of roads - the C part of section should be integrated into our model -> here they use k-means clustering but EM uses k-means for initialisation of gaussain estimate and then iterates to improve the parameters, therefore better](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/dahlkamp.adaptvision06.pdf)



Some to Dos for results and possible modifications:
+ Check for speed of processing and use EM::train_startWithE after first frame using the means and covariances of previous training
+ Try and see what happens if we use EM in susequent frames to predict road pixels using the area predicted as road in the previous image
